When setting up a new Django project, we begin
with a "skeleton" website, which can later be 
built and configured using site-specific
settings, paths, models, views, and templates.

Here are the initial project setup steps:
1. Use the django-admin tool to create a project folder,
initial files, and the manage.py tool.
`django-admin startproject RecipeApp`

2. Use manage.py tool(created above) to create one or more 
django apps 

3. Register the created apps in the project's settings 
configuration file 

4. Map the `urls/paths` of each application appropriately
